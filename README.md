# RSA Algorithm
- Basic implementation of the RSA Algorithm in Python.
- Also gives implementation using PKCS01_OAEP padding, as basic RSA still allows attributes like the number of a particular character used to be visible.
- Generates keys using subroutine in Python's RSA library, or via a new method. 
- Investigation into difference in running times is ongoing.
